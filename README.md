# Multivariate Normal Distribution



## Matlab implementation

## Python implementation
The python implementation is an adaption from Mattia Raccas Matlab Code on Multivariate Normal Distributions. It contains an algorithm to find the nearest positive semi-definite matrix as well as some fixes for problems occuring with Matlab specific functions. Additionally it contains A few test applications using the scikit iris and digits datasets.

The learning performance of the MVN classifier is measured by calculating and plotting the f1-scores.

### Examples
- mvn_test.ipynb: contains a simple test using the scikit iris dataset for an earlier implementation
- mvn_interactive.ipynb: contains an updated version specificly for the iris dataset
- mvn_interactive_digits.ipynb: latest implementation with more cleaned up code and a more flexible interface for different datasets
